# StockPredictions

Question 0.0
How to include an image in a LinkedIn post?

Question 0.1
Do people highlight posts with hashtags?

Question 1
Write LinkedIn post to promote my AI skills.
Popular topics include AutoGen and Prompt Engineering.

AutoGen is an AI framework that can be used to generate code.
AutoGen is driven by Prompt Engineering.

This is a stock prediction model.

Ninety percent of the code generation was done by AutoGen.
Ten percent of the code generation was done manually.
Both took the same amount of time.
The productivity of AutoGen was nine times.

There is a confusion matrix with six different classes to be included in the post.
Class number five is the highest class.
Classes numbered 3, 4, and 5 have gains.

The total percentage gainers in class number 5 is 57.37 percent (23.33 + 18.18 + 15.86)

Future work includes data selection, hyperparameter tuning.

üöÄ Leveraging the Power of AI in Stock Prediction!

Exciting times ahead! I‚Äôve successfully built a cutting-edge stock prediction model with a significant twist. Here are the highlights:

1Ô∏è‚É£ AutoGen Magic: A mind-blowing 90% of the code generation was done using the AutoGen framework! Just to highlight the scale: The time taken for this AI-driven code generation was equal to the time I spent writing the remaining 10% manually. That's a productivity boost of NINE times with AutoGen!

2Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt Engineering: The secret sauce behind driving AutoGen's effectiveness is Prompt Engineering. This symbiotic relationship between the two shows how intelligent prompts can lead to efficient and effective code generation.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Confusion Matrix Insights: The model classifies stocks into six classes. The most notable of which is class number 5 - our highest class. Interestingly, classes 3, 4, and 5 saw gains. And speaking of gains...üìà

‚ú® The total percentage gainers in class number 5 amounted to a whopping 57.37%! (broken down as: 23.33% + 18.18% + 15.86%).

AI continues to astonish me with its capabilities, especially when frameworks like AutoGen are in play. It's a testament to what's possible when technology and innovation come together.

Looking forward to more advancements and collaborations in the AI domain! üåü
